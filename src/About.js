      Hey, I'm Nora. I'm currently doing some freelance design &amp; front-end dev based in San Francisco. I'm interested in how well-designed experiences can shape how we interact with technology.
      <br/><br/>
      I'm happiest when I get to wear a bunch of hats on a team of like-minded, flexible people. I've done work as a UX/UI designer, a product manager, and a front-end developer.
